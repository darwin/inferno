BrookBox is a Purcell-type raytracer implemented in BrookGPU language.

Features of method:
- simple triangular scenes in voxel grid 10x10x10
- primary rays, secodary reflection and refraction rays, shadow rays
- smooth shading

You can execute:
brookbox1s_064.exe - raytracing in resolution  64x64  (1-sided)
brookbox1s_128.exe - raytracing in resolution 128x128 (1-sided)
brookbox1s_256.exe - raytracing in resolution 256x256 (1-sided)
brookbox1s_512.exe - raytracing in resolution 512x512 (1-sided)
brookbox2s_064.exe - raytracing in resolution  64x64  (2-sided)
brookbox2s_128.exe - raytracing in resolution 128x128 (2-sided)
brookbox2s_256.exe - raytracing in resolution 256x256 (2-sided)
brookbox2s_512.exe - raytracing in resolution 512x512 (2-sided)

Usage:
brookbox?s_???.exe <scene.dat>

Program will output raytraced steps into imdebug application.
In 1-sided mode, triangles are considered 1-sided (there is little problem with precision).
In 2-sided mode, triangles are considered 2-sided.
